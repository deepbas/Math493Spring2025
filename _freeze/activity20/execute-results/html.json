Peaks at negative lags suggest the second series leads the first.\n\n- In ecological contexts (like hare vs. lynx), the classic Hudson Bay hare–lynx data show that the hare population tends to peak first, with the lynx population lagging by roughly 1–2 years.\n\n\n### 1.2 Spurious Correlation Caveat\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulate independent series\nset.seed(123)\nfake_data <- tsibble(t=1:100, x=rnorm(100), y=rnorm(100), index=t)\nfake_data |> \n  CCF(x,y) |> autoplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](activity20_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n**Critical Thinking**: Even independent series may show \"significant\" correlations by chance.

Since the correlations remain broadly negative (and small in magnitude) for both positive and negative lags, there’s no clear evidence that temperature systematically leads or lags demand in this dataset. The correlation is negative, suggesting that higher daily temperatures coincide with slightly lower daily electricity demand (or vice versa). One possible explanation is that the observed period or region may use more electricity for heating rather than cooling, so warmer days reduce demand.\n\n\n",
