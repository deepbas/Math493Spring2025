**Theoretical Background: ARIMA($p,d,q$)($P,D,Q$)[$s$] Model Interpretations**

### 1. Autoregressive (AR) Model

An AR(1) model predicts the current value from its immediately preceding value. In its simplest form, it is written as

$$
y_t = c + \phi_1\,y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t,
$$

where  
- $y_t$ is the observed value at time $t$,  
- $c$ is a constant (or drift),  
- $\phi_1$ is the AR coefficient, and  
- $\varepsilon_t$ is the error (white noise) at time $t$.



### 2. Moving Average (MA) Component

An MA(1) model expresses the current value as a function of the current and one past error term:

$$
y_t = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1},
$$

where $\theta_1$ is the MA coefficient. This shows that the noise from the previous period also influences the current observation.



### 3. Combine Them into an ARMA Model

When both AR and MA parts are included, we have an ARMA(1,1) model:

$$
y_t = c + \phi_1\,y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}.
$$

This model now explains the series using both its past values and past errors.



### 4. Incorporate Differencing to Remove Trends

If the original series is nonstationary (for example, it has a trend), we apply differencing. A first difference is defined as

$$
\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}.
$$

Now, you model the differenced series rather than the original series. For instance, an ARMA(1,1) model on the differenced data becomes

$$
\Delta y_t = c + \phi_1\,\Delta y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}.
$$

This step removes linear trends and stabilizes the mean of the series.



### 5. Add Seasonality with Seasonal Differencing

Seasonal patterns can be removed by seasonal differencing. For example, if your data shows a weekly pattern (period $s=7$), the seasonal difference is

$$
\Delta_7 y_t = y_t - y_{t-7}.
$$

If seasonality is also modeled through seasonal AR or MA terms, you can add these effects after differencing.


### 6. Build a Multiplicative Seasonal ARIMA Model

A full seasonal ARIMA model is usually denoted as ARIMA($p,d,q$)($P,D,Q$)[$s$], which combines:

- **Nonseasonal components:** AR($p$), differencing $d$, and MA($q$).
- **Seasonal components:** Seasonal AR($P$), seasonal differencing $D$, and seasonal MA($Q$) with period $s$.

A simplified way to “build up” the full model in one long equation is as follows:

> **Step A:** Apply nonseasonal differencing (order $d$) and seasonal differencing (order $D$ at period $s$). Denote the fully differenced series as
> 
> $$
> z_t = \Delta^d\,\Delta_s^D y_t.
> $$

> **Step B:** Model $z_t$ with nonseasonal AR and MA parts:
> 
> $$
> z_t = c + \phi_1\,z_{t-1} + \cdots + \phi_p\,z_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q\,\varepsilon_{t-q}.
> $$

> **Step C:** Add the seasonal components. For a seasonal AR($P$) and MA($Q$) (applied to the same differenced series), include:
> 
> $$
> -\,\Phi_1\,z_{t-s} - \cdots - \Phi_P\,z_{t-Ps}
> $$
> 
> on the AR side and
> 
> $$
> -\,\Theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-s} - \cdots - \Theta_Q\,\varepsilon_{t-Qs}
> $$
> 
> on the MA side.

> **Step D:** Combine the pieces into one sequential equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_t &= c \\
&\quad + \underbrace{\phi_1\,z_{t-1} + \cdots + \phi_p\,z_{t-p}}_{\text{Nonseasonal AR terms}} \\
&\quad - \underbrace{\Phi_1\,z_{t-s} + \cdots + \Phi_P\,z_{t-Ps}}_{\text{Seasonal AR terms}} \\
&\quad + \varepsilon_t \\
&\quad + \underbrace{\theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q\,\varepsilon_{t-q}}_{\text{Nonseasonal MA terms}} \\
&\quad - \underbrace{\Theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-s} + \cdots + \Theta_Q\,\varepsilon_{t-Qs}}_{\text{Seasonal MA terms}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $z_t$ represents the series after both nonseasonal and seasonal differencing. This equation is a conceptual “blueprint” that shows how each modeling component is added sequentially.

## Example Configurations

### ARIMA(1,1,1) with Drift (Nonseasonal)

In this configuration, we first remove trends by differencing the series, then model the differenced series with one AR term and one MA term.

1. **Nonseasonal Differencing:**
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

2. **Modeling the Differenced Series:**
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta y_t &= c + \phi_1\,\Delta y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

**Key Points:**
- The first difference $\Delta y_t$ helps stabilize the mean.
- $\phi_1$ captures the autoregressive effect on the differenced data.
- $\theta_1$ models the influence of the previous error.

### ARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)[4] with Drift (Seasonal)

This model introduces seasonal differencing with period 4 and includes nonseasonal AR(1) and MA(1) terms along with a seasonal MA(1) component.

1. **Seasonal Differencing:**
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta_4 y_t = y_t - y_{t-4}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

2. **Sequentially Building the Model:**
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   y_t - y_{t-4} &= c + \phi_1\,\Bigl[(y_{t-1} - y_{t-5})\Bigr] + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1} - \Theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-4}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

**Key Points:**

- Seasonal differencing ($y_t - y_{t-4}$) removes periodic effects.
- $\phi_1$ is the nonseasonal AR term applied to the lagged (but also seasonally adjusted) data.
- $\theta_1$ is the nonseasonal MA term.
- $\Theta_1$ is the seasonal MA term that adjusts the error from one season ago.
- $c$ is the drift.

*(Hint: This model applies nonseasonal differencing and includes a seasonal AR(1) component with period 12 along with a nonseasonal MA(1) term.)*

**Answer:**

1. **Nonseasonal Differencing:**
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

   \end{aligned}
   $$

**Key Points:**

- $\Phi_1$ is the seasonal AR coefficient with period 12.
- $\theta_1$ is the nonseasonal MA coefficient.
- The left-hand side shows the nonseasonally differenced data adjusted by the seasonal AR component.
